            Hello Everyone! I'm sure by now you know that I am Lilcrash. <br>
            I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember.
            I play a big variety of games, just to name a few games that I play, Call of Duty, Runescape,
            Pok√©mon, Super Smash Bros, MLB The Show (the only sports game I play) and Minecraft. Those are just a few
            games I play to give you an idea. <br> I started streaming on <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>
            sometime in March of 2014. I got affiliate on twitch sometime in 2018. I have an amazing community that you
            are welcome to join! Click the discord link at the top or click <a href="https://discord.gg/dRYuEdP">here</a> for an invite.
            I started out streaming Minecraft Java version. At That time, it was the only 
            game PC game I could play and stream at the same time. Over the years I learned more about PC gaming
            and slowly switched over. I now mainly play games on PC unless it is a console exclusive. I am 25 years old. I currently
            college majoring in Software Development. If there is anything else you would like to know stop by
            the stream sometime and ask!
            </p>
